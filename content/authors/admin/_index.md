# Hi, Welcome to my homepage!
Ngo Huy Cu received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the M.Eng. degree
in physical electronics from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2015, and 2017,
respectively. He was involved in mixed-signal, and synthesizable digital phase-locked loop (PLL) designs.
His master thesis focused on designing synthesizable fractional-N injection-locked PLL using digital to time converter (DTC).
In 2017, he joined the Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan, where he was involved in the research of deep learning accelerator using FPGA. In 2019, he joined Institute of Memory Technology Research & Development, Kioxia Corporation (formerly Toshiba Memory Corporation), Kawasaki, Japan, where he is involved in the design of analog mixed-signal circuits and architectures for advanced high-speed wireline communication. His current interests include high-speed wireline transceivers, high-speed low-power analog-to-digital converter, and efficient hardware accelerator for deep learning applications.
Mr. Ngo was a recipient of the Japanese Government (MEXT) Scholarship from 2009 to 2017.

<!-- professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
