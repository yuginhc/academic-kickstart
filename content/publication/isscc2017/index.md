abstract: This paper presents a supply regulated synthesizable injection-locked PLL (IL-PLL), using a noise-isolation LDO. The noise-isolation LDO realizes a time-shift operation to isolate the PLL from both supply and LDO noise, so the IL-PLL operation remains robust, even within a noisy SoC. The core layout of the PLL is implemented using solely a foundry provided standard-cell library for a 65nm CMOS process with standard digital design tools. Among synthesizable PLLs, jitter performance of 0.42ps is achieved with 3.8mW power consumption at 0.9GHz oscillation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
